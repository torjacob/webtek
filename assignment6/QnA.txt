1. Why does 0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3 evaluate to false in js?
  This is because 0.1 + 0.2 !== 0.3 in js. As a result of "floating point math",
  this math is based on binary - and as such, rational numbers (0.1 f.ex.)
  whose denominator is not a power of two cannot be represented accurately.
  tl;dr / ie:
  0.1 + 0.2 = 0.3000.....04 , != 0.300

2. What does the method attribute on a form element decide?
  Wether it will be a POST or GET form.

3. Explain why the form fields appear in the URL when the method on form element
  is changed to get?
  This is because the data is sent as URL-variables, and not HTTP transactions
  (POST).

4. Why is it considered bad practice to only validate form input with HTML5
  and/or javascript?
  This is because the data could be manipulated by a malicious user. Server side
  validation is always preferred to include for security's sake - so that the
  submitted data can be confirmed as safe.

5. When is it appropriate to use textarea over input?
  Usually, it is preferred for longer text entries.
  Input has a (usually high) character limit, and the visibilty of the entered
  text is limited for the user - as there is only one line.
  Text areas can be customized so that the user is able to see any amount of
  lines and text wished for by the designer.
