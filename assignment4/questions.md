### Questions:
1. Mobile devices usually ignore autoplay to reduce bandwith-usage. If a video element is paused, it will consume less data than if it were playing.
2. 
3. A responsive site is often more cost effective, as you do not need to host a seperate sub-domain for the mobile site. This makes maintenance easier, as only one site / codebase needs to be updated - instead of two seperate domains. Less time spent = less money spent. There is also an argument to be made for a plausible quicker inital load. As if a user enters https://example.com/, they will not need to be redirected to https://m.example.com/.
