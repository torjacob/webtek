        <p>
            My coding skills include:
            Actionscript 3, Java, Javascript, a little python, and even less C.
            If HTML/CSS are considered programming skills, i suppose it would be pertinent to include those as well.
            Although, my knowledge on the area is limited to the basics for testing JS-servers and web-apps.

        <p>
            I hope to learn more about web-technologies during the course.
            Be that more complex forms of server-client communication, such as sockets, database utilization, or generally improving my HTML and CSS skills.

            I'll be honest, I don't really know what to write in the last paragraph.
            Here's to a good semester!

        <h2>Questions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                The server in a client-server architecture processes requests from the client. It then delivers, or 'serves', the results to the client.
            </li>
            <li>
                The client sends requests to the server, and rerecieves them.
            </li>
            <li>
                An IP-adress is a given device's unique identification on the internet.
            </li>
            <li>
                DNS is an acronym. It stands for Domain Name System.
                The purpose of DNS is to convert a given domain name (www.google.com) to the IP-adress of a server which runs the given website.
                DNS servers can be thought of as the internet's yellow-pages. They look up the number of the website you want to visit.
            </li>
            <li>
                The internet is a global interconnected network of networks (of devices). 
                The web, or WWW, is the information which is shared on this network.
                In other words: The internet is the architecture, and the web is one of the services which run on this architecture.
