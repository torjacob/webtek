1. 
The difference between absolute and fixed positions is in the frame of refrence.

Elements which have an absolute position will keep their position relative to the page - not to the viewport (browser window).
This means that they will scroll with the page, and do not have any regard for wether or not the window itself has ben resized.

Elements which have a fixed position keep their position relative to the browser window. They can clash with other elements which are absolue, 
as they do not regard the same frame of refrence. If you resize the window, or scroll. A fixed element will follow, and keep up with the window itself.

2.
To select the third element within another element - we use the nth-child-selector. 
This selector can be used to choose any child of an element (for example, the third), or a range of children.

In practice:

<div>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
</div>

<style>
    div>p:nth.child(3){ /* Set whatever variables and attributes you want here */ }
</style>
